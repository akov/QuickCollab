QuickCollab allows a user to quickly serve a text file over a
so that other people can collaborate in editing it through a 
web interface. 

I wrote this as a quick and dirty project while learning Python 
to try out web.py

It is unfinished so it will currently try to apply javascript 
syntax highlighting to the file in the web interface interface.

Users synchronize their edits with the server every 15 seconds. No 
files are written or modified until a user clicks the button to 
save the current text to his or her hard drive. 

Uses "CodeMirror" for the editor UI, jQuery, and web.py
